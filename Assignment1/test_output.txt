For case of Test1, I edit two string arrays which have no same elements in them. The input String is: String[] s1 = {"ABCD", "EF"}, and the output is passed based on the running result of getOffset() and getNumErrors().

For case of Test2, I edit two string arrays which have the same elements and same length. The input String is: String[] s2 = {"ABCD", "ABCD"}, and the out put is passed based on the running result of getOffset() and getNumErrors().

For case of Test3, I edit two string arrays, and the second string have two same elements of the first string array. The input String is: String[] s3 = {"ABCD", "CD"}, and the output is passed based on the running result of getOffset() and getNumErrors().

For case of Test4, I edit two string arrays which have the same length, but they have no same elements. The input String is: String[] s4 = {"AB", "CD"}, and the out put is passed based on the running result of getOffset() and getNumErrors().

For case of Test5, I edit two string arrays which the first length is less than the second length, and the elements are different within them. The input String is: String[] s5 = {"D", "AB"}, and the out put is passed based on the running result of getOffset() and getNumErrors().
